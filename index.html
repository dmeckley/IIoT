						<h2>IoT vs IIoT</h2>
						<p>
							If you want to compare IIoT vs IoT, we’ll probably need to define the Internet of Things first. 
							The term refers to the connection of devices (the Things) through the internet so they can collect 
							and share data without human assistance. IoT devices range from smart thermostats to vehicle systems 
							to biochip transponders on farm animals. Even people can be outfitted with sensors connected to the internet.
						</p>
						<p>
							The IoT revolution isn’t just benefitting consumers; it’s also being harnessed for industrial purposes – 
							so much so that it has its own acronym: 
							<a id="IIoT" href="https://www.winsystems.com/industrial-internet-of-things-iiot/">IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things)</a>. 
							IIoT is the use of IoT technology for industrial purposes – from gas pumps to HVAC systems to machinery on the factory floor.

						</div>

						<h3>Benefits of Industrial IoT</h3>
						<p>
							The idea of industrial devices exchanging information isn’t new; they’ve been doing it for years. IIoT, however, 
							brings this to an entirely new level, because it provides a system and standards for universal interconnectivity 
							over IP (Internet Protocol). IP is the key protocol used to exchange information over the internet, no matter 
							what type of device is doing the exchanging.
						</p>
						<p>
							Many currently networked industrial devices are closed systems. They can only communicate with other devices that 
							are on their network and “speak” the same language- i.e. use the same protocols and architecture. By IP-enabling 
							devices, the potential for interconnection over existing network infrastructure is vastly expanded.
						</p>
						<p>
							IoT “things” aren’t just dumb devices that can be turned on and off remotely, they:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>are “smart” devices with their own local logic and processing</li>
							<li>have protocols for exchanging information with each other</li>
							<li>send and receive information and commands over a network (including the internet)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							IIoT brings the potential to bring machine learning and big data technology into play to bring automation technologies 
							to a new level of self-contained performance. Think of sensors (pressure, temperature, vibration, flow, and many more), 
							that are already collecting data, but now that data can be combined with data from other systems and collected, analyzed, 
							and exchanged in new ways.
						</p>
						<p>
							Use cases range from basic system monitoring and control through developing insights and analytics that change the way 
							systems and businesses function. Industrial IoT experts report that these technologies will greatly improve quality control, 
							support sustainable and green practices, and vastly improve supply chain management and efficiency.
						</p>

						<h3>Making the Connection</h3>
						<p>
							Industrial IoT brings alot of potential, but it also comes with substantial challenges. One of the biggest is figuring out 
							how the millions of existing automated devices can be retrofitted and connected to use industrial IoT. Existing automated 
							processes use proprietary protocols, different architectures, and have limited networking ability. They tend to be isolated 
							islands of technology.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Industrial Internet Consortium, a global nonprofit founded in 2014, is addressing this problem. It recently published 
							the Industrial Internet Connectivity Framework (IICF), a blueprint of connectivity standards and a reference architecture 
							for designing interoperable solutions.
						</p>
						<p>
							The IICF framework will make it possible for developers to roll out industrial IoT solutions that are compatible and 
							connectable at a much faster rate.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thanks to the millions of industrial sensors already in place and the development of many new, low-cost wireless sensors, 
							the industrial internet of things is poised to take off. As it does, it will bring new levels of efficiency and capability 
							to all levels of industry.

						<h2>IT vs OT</h2>
						<div class="intro">

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>IT is dynamic</h3>
								<p>
									Comprised of fluid, intertwined technology stacks, IT has a lot of moving parts—which means it also has an 
									incredible number of exploit variants. From network to compute to application to data and more, IT teams are 
									responsible for safeguarding every layer in a stack with its own brand of add-on security (e.g., VPN, SEIM, 
									NGFW, DLP).
								</p>
								<p>
									On top of that, these security teams are caught up in a perpetual game of cat and mouse with attackers who always
									seem to have the advantage and be at least one step ahead. It’s a never-ending cycle of identifying new viruses, 
									updating malware signatures, closing security holes, etc.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>OT is deterministic</h3>
								<p>
									OT systems are engineered for specific, measured, prescribed actions based on content, and not context. 
									That’s determinism. Things only happen one way—the way they were designed to act. If given a certain input, 
									they will always produce a certain output, time and time again. It’s an either/or. For example, you open a 
									valve or you close a valve. There are no in-betweens.
								</p>
								<p>
									No question, the OT threat landscape is scary, but because of its deterministic environment, the nature of attacks 
									is not as dynamic as in the IT world—and the primary security focus becomes about ensuring control.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>IT: Data is king</h3>
								<p>
									IT is about digital information storage, retrieval, transmission, and manipulation. Most businesses want to ensure smooth 
									data flow. For example, Amazon wants to be sure identities are verified, that credit cards are working, and that searches 
									and purchase histories can be used to offer up “you so need this, too” suggestions. None of these crosses over into the 
									physical realm of process control and manual manipulation.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>OT: Process is king</h3>
								<p>
									OT is all about process control, which is why it’s not germane to think about things in the same way you would in the IT 
									world, where defenses are layered (at times, seemingly ad infinitum) onto technology stacks. Industrial organizations 
									typically run a small suite of control applications, and maybe a few more to help manage and maintain systems. For the most 
									part, the environment remains relatively static.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>IT: Gateways are everywhere</h3>
								<p>
									More gateways mean a larger attack surface. And considering that 60 percent of network traffic is bots, it’s no wonder 
									attackers only need to be right once—yet another reason IT guys are one step behind the bad guys. It’s nearly impossible 
									to keep up.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>OT: Fewer gateways</h3>
								<p>
									Fewer gateways, fewer avenues for attackers to pursue. The key is reinforcing armaments at those known gates, moats, 
									and tunnels from the start.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>IT: Confidentiality is priority #1</h3>
								<p>
									In order of importance, priorities are: confidentiality, integrity and availability (the CIA triad). First and foremost, 
									businesses and consumers expect financial, medical and personal data to remain private.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>OT: Control is priority #1</h3>
								<p>
									In OT, an additional priority tops the list, while the rest are flip-flopped. The new order: control, availability, 
									integrity, and confidentiality. Control equates to safety because, in this environment, loss of control could have dire 
									consequences. Next is availability (e.g., we expect to have water at the flick of a faucet), then integrity 
									(e.g., we expect that water to be clean and pure), and finally, confidentiality.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>


						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>IT: Throughput matters</h3>
								<p>
									The amount of data that can be transferredat any given time is a big deal in the IT world, where connected 
									constituents have gone all Oliver Twist, minus the “please, sir.” That means both bandwidth 
									(think of this as a multiple-lane highway) and throughput (the number of cars traveling on the highway at any 
									given time) demands are ever growing.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>OT: Throughput is secondary</h3>
								<p>
									The “information highway” infrastructure is less complicated and less congested in OT. If, say, a four-lane highway 
									were built, it was done so because four lanes were more than adequate to handle the relatively fixed amount of 
									anticipated traffic. Throughput requirements aren’t changing as quickly or drastically as in the IT space.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>IT: Patch Tuesday</h3>
								<p>
									Security patching is so commonplace in IT that vendors have a regular weekly release day. Vulnerabilities are easy for 
									attackers to find. They’re also often only discovered as a result of an exploit. In fact, because of the dynamic nature of 
									IT environments, it’s becoming a rarity to find vulnerabilities pre-exploit.
								</p>
								<p>
									The good news for IT is that, once found, vulnerabilities generally have effective patching available within days to 
									mitigate damage.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-1-2">
								<h3>OT: Patch...decade?</h3>
								<p>
									No matter what, security cannot make critical infrastructure less available or reliable. In fact, it cannot have any 
									negative impact—no disruptions, no slow downs—to the realtime and deterministic operation of critical infrastructure.
								</p>
								<p>
									So even if Patch Tuesdays did exist (which they don’t), they wouldn’t be a viable solution. It’s just not feasible 
									to drop security measures in and expect them to work as they might in IT.
								</p>

					<h1>OEE Formulas</h1>
					<div>
						<h2>What Is OEE?</h2>
						<p>
							OEE stands for Overall Equipment Effectiveness and is used to monitor manufacturing effectiveness. 
							The resulting OEE number, represented as a percentage, is generic and allows comparisons across 
							differing industries. Efficiency is not simply the ratio of machine run time to scheduled time. 
							Look at the situation of your manufacturing line or process running at half speed with 0 downtime. 
							This is truly only 50% efficient. Or what if 10% of the product being produced does not meet your 
							minimum quality and must be reworked. This equates to 90% efficient, which does not take into account 
							the effort to rework or the losses of raw material. There are three factors, all represented as a 
							percentage, taken into consideration for the final OEE result: 
						</p>

							<img src="images/oee_modules/oee.png" alt="OEE Flow Process" />
							<figcaption>OEE Flow Process</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<h3>OEE Availability</h3>
						<p>
							OEE Availability is the ratio between the actual runtime and planned production time.  The planned 
							production time does not included breaks, lunches and other pre-arranged time a production line or 
							process may be down.
						</p>
						<p class="formula">Availability = actual runtime / production time</p>

						<h3>OEE Performance</h3>
						<p>
							OEE Performance is the ratio between the actual number of units started (not the number that have been produced) 
							and the number of units that theoretically can be processed based on the standard rate. The standard rate is the 
							rate that the equipment is designed for. Performance is not based on the number of units produced, but, on what 
							the line was designed to process over a given period of time.
						</p>
						<p class="formula">Performance = actual number of units started / standard rate * actual runtime</p>

						<h3>OEE Quality</h3>
						<p>
							OEE Quality is the ratio between good units produced and the total units that were started.
						</p>
						<p class="formula">Quality = good units produced / actual number of units started</p>

						<h2>OEE Formula</h2>
						<p class="formula">OEE = Availability x Performance x Quality.</p>
